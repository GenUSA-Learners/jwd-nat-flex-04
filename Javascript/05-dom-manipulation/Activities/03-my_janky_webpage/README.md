# My janky webpage!

* This project will have you create a janky webpage that uses a number of event listeners to create special effects and interaction!  The website is 'janky' because the page will be useless and doesn't even have to look pretty- but it will have some interactivity.  It is a chance to mess around with using Javascript, in particular **event listeners** webpage.    The project is in 3 steps:

+ 1)  Add a **div**  and then put a child **<h2>** with some text in the div, for instance something like- 'This is my janky site!'.    Using the 'styles.css' give **div** a height of at least 200px and some background-color. Add color to the **<h2>** text.   Make sure both your CSS and JS file are linked to the *index.html*!

+ 2)  Add some more html elements and divs.  Feel free to use buttons **<btn>**  images **<img>** input  **<input>** lists **<ul>** or any html element you'd like!  Keep in mind you'll be using Javascript to make the html elements interactive!

+ 3) Make it Janky!  Add a number of **Event Listeners** code. Put **At least 3** Listeners and the more the merrier! Start of easy if you feel lost but feel free to add as much complexity as you would like!
