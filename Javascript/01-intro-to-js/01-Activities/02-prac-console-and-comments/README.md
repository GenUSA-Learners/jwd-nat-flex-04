# Comments and the Console

## Instructions

1. `console.log`

	- Using the `unsolved` folder as your 'root folder', create an `index.html` file, link the `script.js` file, open the html file in the browser, and inspect the page with your developer tools.

	- You'll know your js file is properly linked when you can see the message in the console.

2. `Comments`

	- Practice commenting out different console.logs to see if you can make a coherent message in the console
